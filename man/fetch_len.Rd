\title{Calculate the fetch length around a point}
\usage{
fetch_len(p, bearings, shoreline, dmax, spread = 0, projected = FALSE,
  check_inputs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{SpatialPoints* object of length 1 (single point).}

\item{bearings}{Vector of bearings, in degrees.}

\item{shoreline}{SpatialLines* or SpatialPolygons* object representing the
shoreline.}

\item{dmax}{Maximum value of fetch length, returned if there is no land
within a distance of \code{dmax} from a given bearing.}

\item{spread}{Vector of relative bearings (in degrees) for which
to calculate fetch around each main bearing (see details).}

\item{projected}{Should projected coordinates be used to calculate fetch?}

\item{check_inputs}{Should the validity of inputs be checked? It is
recommended to keep this TRUE, unless this function is called repeatedly from
another function that already checks inputs.}
}
\value{
A named vector representing the fetch length for each direction
 given in \code{bearings}.
}
\description{
Given a point, a shoreline layer and a vector of wind directions (bearings),
\code{fetch_len} calculates the distance from point to shore for each bearing.
}
\details{
The fetch length (or fetch) is the distance of open water over which the wind
can blow in a specific direction. Note that bearings represent the direction
from where the wind originates.

The optional \code{spread} argument defines relative directions that are
added to each main bearing to produce a set of sub-bearings. The fetch lengths
calculated for each sub-bearing are averaged with weights proportional to
\code{cos(spread)}. By default, \code{spread = 0} and fetch length is
calculated for the main bearings only.

If \code{projected} is FALSE (the default), the input data must be in WGS84
geographic (longitude, latitude) coordinates. Geodesic distances are calculated
using the Vincenty ellipsoid formula from the geosphere R package. All
distance are expressed in meters.

If \code{projected} is TRUE, the input data (\code{p} and \code{shoreline})
must share the same projection. Projected distances are calculated with the
rgeos R package. All distances are expressed in the projection's coordinates.

If the shoreline layer is given as SpatialPolygons*, the function verifies
that the input point is outside all polygons (i.e. in water). If this is
not the case, it issues a warning and returns a vector of \code{NA}.
